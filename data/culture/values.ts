      type: "key-value",
      content: [
        { key: "Space", value: "Czech Republic has to do with limited space. This influences Czech’s perception of distances; even a one-hour drive is a significant undertaking. Vast majority of the population lives in apartment block buildings. Mobility is low; people are reluctant to move for work due to housing shortages and strong attachment to their hometowns." },
        { key: "Time", value: "Time is a commodity. People are expected to be on time. The 'academic quarter-hour' (15 min lateness) is tolerated less nowadays; in business, being more than 5 minutes late is inappropriate. The daily schedule begins and ends earlier than in western Europe." },
        { key: "Status", value: "Czechs are egalitarian and frown on outward status symbols. Knowledge and ability are respected ('clothes make a man'). Formal vs. informal address is crucial. The elderly have prerogatives (e.g., seats on transport). Dress code: frown on shabby clothing, but work dress is often casual; entertainment (theater) requires formal wear." },
        { key: "Virtues", value: "1. Sense of Humor (taking things lightly). 2. Modesty (disagreeing with compliments). 3. Disregard for material (tipping is rounding up, not paying for service). 4. Down-to-Earth Mentality." },
        { key: "Family", value: "Family ties are closer than in America, often due to space limitations." },
        { key: "Drinking habits", value: "Czechs consume the most beer per capita in the world. Wine and beer are never combined, though some put liquor in beer." },
        { key: "Eating habits", value: "Eating out is a treat, though becoming more common. Table etiquette is vital (knife and fork continental style, no slurping). Drinks traditionally served after meals. Strict course order (soup, main, salad, dessert). Unusual food combinations (e.g., rice and fried chicken) are disliked." },
        { key: "Hygiene", value: "'Cleanliness is half your health.' Czechs are conscious of private cleanliness (shoes off at home, evening showers) but historically less conscious of body odor/deodorants than Americans." },
        { key: "Education", value: "Academic titles are very important and widely used in address." },
        { key: "Czechs and foreigners", value: "Attitude is a mix of superiority (ridiculing strange habits) and inferiority (respect for economic/cultural achievements of others)." },
        { key: "Czechs and races", value: "Homogeneous environment for 40 years led to xenophobia. Romany/Gypsy minority faces racism. Blacks are viewed with timidity but no negative connotations. Vietnamese are seen as hard-working." }

      type: "key-value",
      content: [
        { key: "Meeting new people", value: "Difficult to make new friends quickly. Usually happens through work/clubs or introduction by mutual friends. Friendship forms after a long time. Meeting strangers in public places (except bars) is rare." },
        { key: "Groups", value: "Less likely to congregate in professional/interest groups than Westerners. Business and pleasure are strictly separated. Networking is not a common concept. A legacy of communism (mandatory participation) caused dislike for group work." },
        { key: "Teamwork", value: "Great individual athletes/workers, but often struggle with teamwork compared to inferior teams working well together." },
        { key: "Family", value: "Closer ties due to proximity. Children often live with parents after marriage due to housing shortage. Low mobility." },
        { key: "Men vs. women", value: "Radical feminism unpopular. Women work in many professions but are still expected to be primary caretakers. Few women in top politics/management, many in education/research." }

        "<strong>Physical Contact:</strong> Embracing is reserved. Cheek kissing is rare as a greeting (except when congratulating).",
        "<strong>Communication Style:</strong> Czechs are afraid to show lack of understanding. Westerners seem to ask too many direct questions. Czechs often answer 'How are you?' negatively and rarely boast. Complaining is socially acceptable.",
        "<strong>Politeness:</strong> Men are helpful to women (coats, doors, seats). IMPORTANT: Men usually enter restaurants *first* (to check for safety/lead the way, a historical tradition)."

        "<strong>Restaurants:</strong> Man enters first. Seat yourself (unless fancy). Sharing tables with strangers is normal. Knife/fork crossed = pause; parallel = finished. Say 'Dobrou chuť'.",
